# Agency Swarm Base Template

This repository serves as an example implementation of the Agency Swarm framework, showcasing example agents, tools, and a CI testing workflow.

## Project Description

This template provides a starting point for building AI agent teams using the Agency Swarm framework. It includes:

- Example agent implementations
- Custom tool examples
- A CI testing workflow
- A comprehensive test suite
- A `.cursorrules` file containing the prompt for AI assistance

The purpose of this template is to demonstrate best practices for setting up an Agency Swarm project and to provide a foundation that developers can build upon for their own AI agent applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<this_repo>>
   cd <repo_name>>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   Use the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file. It will be read automatically by `dotenv`.

4. Set up development environment:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-dev-env.sh
   ./setup-dev-env.sh
   ```

5. Explore the `agents` and `tools` directories to see example implementations.

6. Run the example agency:
   ```python
   python <Agency_Name>/LocalAgency.py
   ```

## Development Workflow & Standards

### ðŸŒ¿ Branch Structure
```bash
main        # Production-ready code (PM controlled)
staging     # Pre-production testing (merge your branches here)
```

### ðŸ’¬ Commit Message Format & Pull Request Guidelines

```bash
TYPE/SP-X: Brief Description

# Real Examples
FEAT/SP-5: OAuth2 Social Login Integration
FIX/SP-2: Resolve API Rate Limiting Bug
REFAC/SP-3: Optimize Database Query Performance
DOCS/SP-1: Update API Authentication Docs
TEST/SP-2: Add E2E Tests for Payment Flow
```

**Type Categories:**
- `FEAT` - New feature
- `FIX` - Bug fix
- `REFAC` - Code restructuring/refactoring
- `DOCS` - Documentation
- `TEST` - Testing changes

**Story Points (SP):**
- `SP-1` - Quick fix (< 1 hour)
- `SP-2` - Simple task (2-4 hours)
- `SP-3` - Medium task (1 day)
- `SP-5` - Complex task (2-3 days)
- `SP-8` - Major feature (3+ days)
- `SP-13` - Project milestone (5+ days)

#### Quick Tips
1. Keep PRs focused and under SP-5 (for agile DevOps)
2. Add screenshots for UI changes
3. Tag your Project Manager in urgent reviews (on Slack)
4. Use draft PRs for early feedback

### ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

1. **Start New Work**
   ```bash
   git checkout staging
   git pull
   git checkout -b feat/SP-3: <description>
   ```

2. **Pre-commit Checks**
   The following checks run automatically on crucial files:
   - Code formatting (Ruff)
   - Linting
   - Secret scanning
   - Branch naming
   - Tests

3. **Making Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "[TYPE][SP-X]: description"
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request to Staging**
   ```bash
   git checkout staging
   git pull
   git checkout your-branch
   git merge staging
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

5. **After PR Approval**
   - Code is merged to `staging`
   - Railway deploys for testing
   - PM reviews and merges to `main` if approved

## Code Quality

### Pre-commit Hooks
We use pre-commit hooks with Ruff for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Format code
ruff format .

# Fix lint issues
ruff check --fix .

# Run all hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Running Tests

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions workflow includes:
- Code formatting check
- Linting
- Security scanning
- Unit tests
- Integration tests

## Security Considerations

- No credentials in code
- Use environment variables
- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning in CI/CD

## Best Practices

1. **Code Review**
   - Review for performance
   - Check security implications
   - Verify test coverage
   - Ensure documentation

2. **Branch Management**
   - Keep branches up to date
   - Delete merged branches
   - Use meaningful branch names

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README for new features
   - Document API changes
   - Add inline code comments

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Test edge cases

## Troubleshooting

If pre-commit hooks fail:
1. Review the error messages
2. Run format and lint fixes
3. Commit changes
4. If issues persist, consult team lead
